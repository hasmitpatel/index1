<h1>Animal Torture</h1>
<p>The shocking number of animal cruelty cases reported every day is just the tip of the icebergâ€”most cases
     are never reported. Unlike violent crimes against people, cases of animal abuse are not compiled 
     by state or federal agencies, making it difficult to calculate just how common they are. However, 
    we can use the information that is available to try to understand and prevent cases of abuse.</p>
    <p>The animals whose abuse is most often reported are dogs, cats, horses and livestock.
         Undercover investigations have revealed that animal abuse abounds in the factory farm industry. 
         But because of the weak protections afforded to livestock 
        under state cruelty laws, only the most shocking cases are reported, and few are ever prosecuted.</p>
