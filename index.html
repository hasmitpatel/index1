      <h2>Animal Protection</h2>
      <h2>Why we need to protect animals</h2>
      <blockquote><p>The term wildlife not only covers wild animals but also accommodates all 
          undomesticated creatures including birds, insects, plants, even microscopic organisms. 
          To maintain a healthy ecological balance on this earth, all living creatures should be 
          treated as important as humans</p></blockquote>
      <p>There are a lot of wonders in the world and among them are wildlife species, such as bears,
        mountain goats, wolves, elk, and deer. Most people think that there is an abundance of wildlife 
        species in the world, but the truth is, their numbers are dwindling and if nothing is done about 
        it, these species might become endangered and extinct. Animals become endangered all the 
        time and people are not aware about it. Thankfully, more and more preservation programs have been 
        established to ensure that these animals are protected, bred, and well-taken care of. These 
        preservation programs motivate and increase the awareness of the public regarding the 
        proper management of natural resources.</p>
