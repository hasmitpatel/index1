<h1>Animal Adoption</h1>
<p>Pet adoption is the process of taking responsibility for a pet that a previous owner has abandoned or
 released to a shelter or rescue organization. Common sources for adoptable pets are animal shelters and res
 cue groups. Some organizations give adopters ownership of the pet, while others use a guardianship model 
 wherein the organization retains some control over the animal's future use or care.
Online pet adoption sites have databases of pets being housed by thousands of animal 
shelters and rescue groups, and are searchable by the public.</p>
